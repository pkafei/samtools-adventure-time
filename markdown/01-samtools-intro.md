# What are SAMtools?

* Samtools provide various utilities for manipulating alignments in the SAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).

* A BAM file is just a SAM file but stored in binary; you should always convert your SAM files into BAM to save storage space and BAM files are faster to manipulate (http://bit.ly/1olqwmP).

* In this workshop we are going to use SAMtools to *index*, *import* and *visualize*
